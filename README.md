# NamShrub_GGJ2023
In this game play, you and your friends play the role of adventurers who take turns to stick hands into the Nam Shrub.

The Nam Shrub is a wood beast who lives in the forest.

This game was obviously influced by the Wood Beast scene from Flash Gordon where the protagonist and Prince Barin (Timothy Dalton)
take turns to put their hand in a giant tree stump.
At the bottom of one of the stumps many holes is the trees ancient host which will sting (and kill) anyone unlucky enough to pick the wrong entrance.

The game has few rules: players should take turns in placing their hand in the tree but they may choose how far to place their hand inside,
so its possible to feint putting your hand in far enough to be in danger.
